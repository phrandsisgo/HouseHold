Read me:
-Please keep in mind that this is my first Fullstack Flutter project.
-this is still under construction so a lot of the content can still change.
-My goal is to publish it on the android store by february 2021

This is a list what is still missing for this Project to end:
 finish the function to enable the User to update/change Items to his household Database
 create a function that the Users Can share their Household database with the people who share the same household.
 make a function to push the expiration date further away. (like the snooze function but for a couple days insted minutes)
 testing all the functions on an actual phone.
 Test it on some potential users so that they can give me feedback so I can improve from them.
 find bugs and refactor the code so no dead code is available anymore, and everything runs smooth.
 redisign it (that it looks according to the User reviews of the app)
 add the security rules on the Firestore Backend.
 get acces to a mac and make an iOS version of it.
 publish it on both the google playstore and the ios app store.

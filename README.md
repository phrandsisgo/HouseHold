This is an abandoned & unfinished project! I haven't worked on it since about 2020. 


Hello I am trying to write an app that helps against food wasting. The goal is to remind users of this app of the expiration dates of their grocerys.
A user should be able to to add an Item with the expiration date to his/her database. The app will remember in an pre set time when the items are going to expire.
This app is using a backend from Google firestore. 
The reason why I am using a backend is that the user can share his/her items with his/her roommates or family in the same household.


-Please keep in mind that this is my first Fullstack Flutter project.
-this is still under construction so a lot of the content can still change.
This project was abandoned by me since I've lost interest in programming but still cool if you stop by and give it a look!

This is a list what is still missing for this Project to end:
<<<<<<< HEAD
# create a function that the Users Can share their Household database with the people who share the same household.
# make a function to push the expiration date further away. (like the snooze function but for a couple days insted minutes)
# testing all the functions on an actual phone.
# Test it on some potential users so that they can give me feedback so I can improve from them.
# find bugs and refactor the code so no dead code is available anymore, and everything runs smooth.
# redisign it (that it looks according to the User reviews of the app)
# add the security rules on the Firestore Backend.
# get acces to a mac and make an iOS version of it.
# publish it on both the google playstore and the ios app store.
=======
 finish the function to enable the User to update/change Items to his household Database
